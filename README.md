## Our Review of Sugar Casino

Overall, our review of Sugar Casino is extremely positive. We found that
this casino has many qualities that set it apart from the competition.

Here are some key elements that made us appreciate our gaming experience
on this platform:

### Colorful Graphics

The visuals of Sugar Casino are simply stunning, and we have never seen
such a colorful interface before. Here, the predominant color is pink,
which is reminiscent of the candies and sweets that are the main theme
of this platform.

These graphics make the homepage much more enjoyable. In addition, it
features a sidebar on the left that allows you to access categories with
just a few clicks.

Everything is perfectly streamlined, which allows for a quick上手 and
mastery of the site\'s functionality in just a few seconds.

### A Near-Perfect Game Library

One of the elements that lead us to believe that Sugar Casino can be a
benchmark in the industry is its game catalog.

Even though some competing platforms may have a more extensive library,
the 2,500+ creations offered here are more than enough.

We found two distinct categories, labeled \_Casino\_ and \_Live
Casino\_, which allow for very quick access to all your favorite games.

Thus, you will be able to try your luck on slot machines, but also table
games, original games, and live games.

### Numerous and Varied Payment Methods

Finally, we appreciated the diversity of payment methods offered, which
allow players to have the embarrassment of choice when it comes to
depositing or withdrawing their winnings.

Here, you will be able to rely on credit cards, bank transfers,
electronic wallets, and cryptocurrencies to make transactions.

In addition, there are no deposit or withdrawal fees, and the limits set
by the casino are more than fair, as you will see throughout this
article.

You will need to wager x36 on the bonus amount to be able to withdraw
any potential winnings.

The maximum bet is €4 per game round, and you must deposit at least €20
to activate each of these welcome offers.

The free spins are awarded on the slot machine Starburst, an iconic
creation from the online game provider NetEnt.

#### Friday Candies Party

There is also a weekly bonus called Friday Candies Party which allows
you to receive a rather interesting offer every Friday.

The bonus granted to players will depend on the amount deposited, which
must be greater than €200 and has no maximum limit.

Below you will find the details of this offer, which allows you to
receive a bonus between 20% and 100%:

-   Deposit between €200 and €1,000 = 20% Bonus
-   Deposit between €1,001 and €2,000 = 50% Bonus
-   Deposit between €2,001 and €3,000 = 70% Bonus
-   Deposit over €3,001 = 100% Bonus
